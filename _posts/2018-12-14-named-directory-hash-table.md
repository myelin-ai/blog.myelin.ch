title:  "The zsh named directory hash table"

Like all cool things, it started with [a reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/zsh/comments/9eklqu/shortcut_links_in_zsh/).
Someone recommended to use the zsh directory hash table.
It enabled me to set custom directory replacements like this:

This worked nicely, but I was curious about how it worked.  
Since is a zsh built-in function, the docs can be accessed with `man zshbuiltins`.

> hash can be used to directly modify the contents of the command hash table, and the named directory hash table. Normally one would modify these tables by modifying oneâ€™s PATH (for the command hash table) or by creating appropriate shell parameters (for the named directory hash table). The choice of hash table to work on is determined by the -d option; without the option the command hash table is used, and with the option the named directory hash table is used.

To display the command hash table contents, run `hash`. For the directory hash table, run `hash -d`.

So the use of `hash -d github=~/Documents/GitHub` only added the value to a cache.  
I found out that you can also add a static named directory like this:

The documentation for this behaviour can be found [here](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Expansion.html#Static-named-directories).  
So every variable starting with a slash is considered. Also every users home is included automatically.
